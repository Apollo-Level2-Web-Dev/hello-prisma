# Hello Prisma

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access and management for applications. It allows developers to interact with databases using a type-safe query builder and provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer for seamless data modeling. Prisma supports various databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
